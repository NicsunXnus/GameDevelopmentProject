# GameDevelopmentModule
During the module, I had a group project where we were to develop a ready to market game from scratch with Unreal Engine 5. We chose to develop a Dodgeball themed First Person perspective game with a different boss and theme for each level.I was the AI developer for the game and designed the movements and reactions of the boss AI for the court and crab levels. I was also the designer and creator of the crab level. 

## Many Levels
